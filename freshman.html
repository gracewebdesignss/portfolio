	<h1>High School Freshmen Bucket List</h1>
	<h3 class="author-text">By: Gracie Gallagher, January 10th, 2020</h3>

	<h2>1) Get Organized</h2>
	<p class="main-text">In middle school, it’s easy to get away with <em>disorganization</em>. In high school, with six different classes all over the campus, <em>strange</em> new schedules, and a bunch of people you’ve never met before, <strong>organization</strong> is key to staying <strong>sane</strong>! Buy sticky notes, a few three-ring binders with dividers, notebooks, highlighters…whatever it takes to keep you on track! Also, those calendar organizers (or reminder binders, as my school calls them) that are given out at the beginning of the school year are more crucial than they appear. You can write down all your homework and assignments in them, and they’ll be a life-saver to you for the rest of high school…so make sure to use them!</p>

	<h2>2) Participate in the club community</h2>
	<p class="main-text">Find a club that <em>interests</em> you, and join one. Clubs are <strong>interests</strong> in that you can meet with people who enjoy similar things that you do, make a whole bunch of new friends, and participate in lots of cool activities. If you’re very involved with a certain club, this could also be <em>great</em> for college apps (in the very far-off <strong>future</strong>!).</p>
	<br>
	<p class="main-text">Alternatively, you can also start a club! You can invite friends to join and meet new people through recruitment. It’s a great way to really get involved in your high school. Also, being a club president for all four years of high school is a great way to show colleges your commitment and drive.</p>

	<h2>3) Taking challenging classes</h2>
	<p class="main-text">This might seem <em>intimidating</em>, but seriously: <em>take the leap</em>! Taking challenging honors or AP classes is a great way to grow mentally and improve your <strong>GPA</strong>. Teachers definitely demand a lot more in high school, and this is going to sound cheesy…but if you believe you can do it, and you work hard at it, those classes are perfectly doable. If you’re trying your best and the classes are still too difficult for you, then you can always drop out; but, if you never try at all, you won’t be tapping your full <strong>potential</strong>!</p>

	<h2>4) Look into AP and SAT subject tests</h2>
	<p class="main-text">I know it isn’t the most appealing item on this bucket list, but these tests really are <em>important</em>. I had no idea what an SAT Subject test was during my freshman year—the year I took Biology. Therefore, while I took the AP Biology test that year, I didn’t take the subject test until I learned about it sophomore year. By then, I’d already <strong>forgotten</strong> a lot of the material and had to <em>re-study</em>. Don’t make my mistake! If you’re already taking an honors class, you could easily buy a prep book and study for the corresponding AP and SAT Subject test, too. <br>You don’t have to even take the class to take its AP test. If you’re really into psychology, for example, you can buy an AP Psychology prep book and self-study. You shouldn’t <strong>overburden</strong> yourself with a whole bunch of these tests your freshman year, but it’s a good idea to get started on at least one or two.</p>

	<h2>5) Find your niche!</h2>
	<p class="main-text">This is so <em>integral</em> to high school! Find what you like and what you’re good at, and find a community in your high school with fosters this. For example, if you’re really into acting, take drama classes, join the Drama Club, and maybe even try out for a few school productions. Try out for a sport if you’re athletic, or if you play an instrument, join the school band or orchestra. <strong>There are so many options out there</strong>. Just make sure not to <em>seclude</em> yourself from the rest of the high school community! This will also prove to be beneficial to you in the long run because colleges like seeing concentrated extracurriculars—that is, an applicant which is very strong in a certain niche. The earlier, the better. It’s a little too late to start looking your senior year.</p>

	<h2>6) Befriend uperclassmen</h2>
	<p class="main-text">They really aren’t that scary in reality! When you first enter high school, everyone will look so intimidating—e<strong>specially the juniors and seniors</strong>. I remember entering high school, seeing someone with a fully grown beard, and <em>freaking out</em>. Friendships with upperclassmen, however, are some of the most rewarding friendships high school has to offer. Upperclassmen are almost done with high school. They’ve taken the classes you’re going to take and have countless pieces of advice to offer. They’re also great tutors and can show you around campus if you’re lost—don’t miss out! Snag one while you can. Inside that hormonal, sleep-deprived shell is an actual human being.</p>

	<hr>
	<h2>7) Attend school events</h2>
	<p class="main-text">It might seem <em>daunting</em> to go to high school events, but really—<strong>do it</strong>! Football games, dances, movie nights, fundraisers, etc. are <em>great</em> ways to meet new people, get to know your school better, and have a lot of fun. I know lots of people who dearly regret not getting involved during freshman year because they thought school activities were lame or because they were too scared to try them out. Freshman year is the year where you’ll have the most free time, so make use of it!</p>

	<hr>
	<h2>8) Meet new people</h2>
	<p class="main-text">Don’t be afraid of meeting people from other middle schools—and don’t seclude yourself with the same group of people you’ve known since kindergarten! This doesn’t mean you should <em>ditch</em> them completely, but try and make <em>new</em> friends, too. Meet people from different friend groups–<strong>and be friendly</strong>! Even if your high school is very cliquey, don’t automatically reject people who may be very different from you. High school only lasts four years, and it’s a great place to meet a huge variety of people. Make the most of it. Don’t b</p>

	<hr>
	<h2>9) Start volunteering</h2>
	<p class="main-text">Depending on your high school, there might be a service learning requirement for all grades. Volunteering not only completes these hours, <em>but it’s rewarding</em>, too. Not to mention, it’s great for college apps. (Man, that’s becoming annoying.) It’s a little more difficult to find good volunteer jobs when you’re still thirteen or fourteen, <strong>but they certainly exist</strong>. Ask around locally or find a virtual job through places like VolunteerMatch. (Links to an external site.) You can also ask your high school guidance counselor or teachers for upcoming volunteer opportunities. Find something that you’ll enjoy—and find something that you can stay committed to.</p>

	<hr>
	<h2>10) Try new things</h2>
	<p class="main-text"><strong>This is a must</strong>. High school will be a lot more <em>rewarding</em> if you venture out of your comfort zone and try new things! (And no, I don’t mean <em>illegal</em> things. Unless you really want a mugshot, speaking of which… (Links to an external site.)) This ties into almost everything on this list. In general, don’t be afraid to chase after opportunities or do things you’ve never done before. High school is a cesspool of change, and it only gets harder when you’re afraid of it.</p>
